# project overview
the game is a "space invaders" clone, this clone will have an array of changes such as: a boss, multiple enemy types and power ups, there for seperating it from the original and making it different 
## new gameplay
a boss will be added in future updates, there will be enemies that have a higher health pool, structures will be added later down the line to challenge and entice the player

### updates
the updated gameplay will have stuff like nutron bombs, these bombs will have a 10 second  cooldown between uses
### multiple enemy types 
will include some sort of boss that has more than 1 health and have a special attack, somthing like a lazer that you have to avoid at all costs
### weapons (player)
the player will be able to aquire a power up of sorts, somthing like a few seconds of invulnerability or extra damage
### weapons (enemy)
in later stages the enemies will become faster in both movement and fire rate, and perhaps take more damage to kill, this could make later levels harder to test the player and thier ability 
### hidden can of beans
